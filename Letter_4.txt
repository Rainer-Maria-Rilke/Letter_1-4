Worpswede, near Bremen
July 16, 1903
About ten days ago I left Paris, tired and quite sick, and traveled to this great
northern plain, whose vastness and silence and sky ought to make me well again.
But I arrived during a long period of rain; this is the first day it has begun to let
up over the restlessly blowing landscape, and I am taking advantage of this
moment of brightness to greet you , dear Sir.
My dear Mr. Kappus: I have left a letter from you unanswered for a long
time; not because I had forgotten it — on the contrary: it is the kind that one
reads again when one finds it among other letters, and I recognize you in it as if
you were very near. It is your letter of May second, and I am sure you remember
it. As I read it now, in the great silence of these distances, I am touched by your
beautiful anxiety about life, even more than I was in Paris, where everything
echoes and fades away differently because of the excessive noise that makes
Things tremble. Here, where I am surrounded by an enormous landscape, which
the winds move across as they come from the seas, here I feel that there is no one
anywhere who can answer for you those questions and feelings which, in their
depths, have a life of their own; for even the most articulate people are unable to
help, since what words point to is so very delicate, is almost unsayable. But even
so, I think that you will not have to remain without a solution if you trust in
Things that are like the ones my eyes are now resting upon. If you trust in
Nature, in the small Things that hardly anyone sees and that can so suddenly
become huge, immeasurable; if you have this love for what is humble and try very
simply, as someone who serves, to win the confidence of what seems poor: then
everything will become easier for you, more coherent and somehow more
reconciling, not in your conscious mind perhaps, which stays behind, astonished,
but in your innermost awareness, awakeness, and knowledge. You are so young,
so much before all beginning, and I would like to beg you, dear Sir, as well as I
can, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love
the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very
foreign language. Don’t search for the answers, which could not be given to you
now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live
everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you
will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer. Perhaps
you do carry within you the possibility of creating and forming, as an especially
blessed and pure way of living; train your for that — but take whatever comes,
with great trust, and as long as it comes out of your will, out of some need of
your innermost self, then take it upon yourself, and don’t hate anything. Sex is
difficult; yes. But those tasks that have been entrusted to us are difficult; almost
everything serious is difficult; and everything is serious. If you just recognize this
and manage, out of yourself, out of your own talent and nature, out of your own
experience and childhood and strength, to achieve a wholly individual relation to
sex (one that is not influenced by convention and custom), then you will no
longer have to be afraid of losing yourself and becoming unworthy of your
dearest possession.
Bodily delight is a sensory experience, not any different from pure looking or
the feeling with which a beautiful fruit fills the tongue; it is a great, an infinite
learning that is given to us, a knowledge of the world, the fullness and the
splendor of all knowledge. And it is not our acceptance of it that is bad; what is
bad is that most people misuse this learning and squander it and apply it as a
stimulant on the tired places of their lives and as a distraction rather than as a
way of gathering themselves for their highest moments. People have even made
eating into something else: necessity on the one hand, excess on the other; have
muddied the clarity of this need, and all the deep, simple needs in which life
renews itself have become just as muddy. But the individual can make them clear
for himself and live them clearly (not the individual who is dependent, but the
solitary man). He can remember that all beauty in animals and plants is a silent,
enduring form of love and yearning, and he can see the animal, as he sees plants,
patiently and willingly uniting and multiplying and growing, not out of physical
pleasure, not out of physical pain, but bowing to necessities that are greater than
pleasure and pain, and more powerful than will and withstanding. If only human
beings could more humbly receive this mystery — which the world is filled with,
even in its smallest Things —, could bear it, endure it, more solemnly, feel how
terribly heavy it is, instead of taking it lightly. If only they could be more reverent
toward their own fruitfulness, which is essentially one, whether it is manifested as
mental or physical; for mental creation too arises from the physical, is of one
nature with it and only like a softer, more enraptured and more eternal repetition
of bodily delight. “The thought of being a creator, of engendering, of shaping” is
nothing without the continuous great confirmation and embodiment in the
world, nothing without the thousandfold assent from Things and animals—and
our enjoyment of it is so indescribably beautiful and rich only because it is full of
inherited memories of the engendering and birthing of millions. In one creative
thought a thousand forgotten nights of love come to life again and fill it with
majesty and exaltation. And those who come together in the nights and are
entwined in rocking delight perform a solemn task and gather sweetness, depth,
and strength for the song of some future poets, who will appear in order to say
ecstasies that are unsayable. And they call forth the future; and even if they have
made a mistake and embrace blindly, the future comes anyway, a new human
being arises, and on the foundation of the accident that seems to be accomplished
here, there awakens the law by which a strong, determined seed forces its
way through to the egg cell that openly advances to meet it. Don’t be confused by
surfaces; in the depths everything becomes law. And those who live the mystery
falsely and badly (and they are very many) lose it only for themselves and
nevertheless pass it on like a sealed letter, without knowing it. And don’t be
puzzled by how many names there are and how complex each life seems. Perhaps
above them all there is a great motherhood, in the form of a communal yearning.
The beauty of the girl, a being who (as you so beautifully say) “has not yet
achieved anything,” is motherhood that has a presentiment of itself and begins to
prepare, becomes anxious, yearns. And the mother’s beauty is motherhood that
serves, and in the old woman there is a great remembering. And in the man too
there is motherhood, it seems to me, physical and mental; his engendering is also
a kind of birthing, and it is birthing when he creates out of his innermost
fullness. And perhaps the sexes are more akin than people think, and the great
renewal of the world will perhaps consist in one phenomenon: that man and
woman, freed from all mistaken feelings and aversions, will seek each other not as
opposites but as brother and sister, as neighbors, and will unite as human beings,
in order to bear in common, simply, earnestly, and patiently, the heavy sex that
has been laid upon them.
But everything that may someday be possible for many people, the solitary
man can now, already, prepare and build with his own hands, which make fewer
mistakes. Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain
it causes you. for those who are near you are far away, you write, and this shows
that the space around you is beginning to grow vast. And if what is near you is far
away, then your vastness is already among the stars and is very great; be happy
about your growth, in which of course you can’t take anyone with you, and be
gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and
don’t torment them with your doubts and don’t frighten them with your faith or
joy, which they wouldn’t be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true
feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn’t necessarily have
to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life
in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing
old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust. Avoid providing material for
the drama that is always stretched tight between parents and children; it uses up
much of the children’s strength and wastes the love of the elders, which acts and
warms even if it doesn’t comprehend. Don’t ask for any advice from them and
don’t expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for
you like and inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a
blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step
outside it.
It is good that you will soon be entering a profession that will make you
independent and will put you completely on your own, in every sense. Wait
patiently to see whether your innermost life feels hemmed in by the form this
profession imposes. I myself consider it a very difficult and very exacting one,
since it is burdened with enormous conventions and leaves very little room for a
personal interpretation of its duties. but your solitude will be a support and a
home for you, even in the midst of very unfamiliar circumstances, and from it
you will find all your paths. All my good wishes are ready to accompany you, and
my faith is with you.
Yours,
Rainer Maria Rilke
